## APS Assignment - ETL PROCESS ##

At my data developer role within APS(2025) - ETLs are a huge part of my daily work. Hence, during my interview process I was given an assignment to create an ETL process.
<br />
The structure goes as follows:
- **Staging Tables** – `EXTRACT.sql`
- **Transforming Tables** – `TRANSFORM.sql`
- **Loading Tables** – `LOAD.sql`
<br />
Along side the ETL process, I also had to create SQL Queries to be used for reporting:
<br />
- **BI Engineering** – `Reports.sql`
<br />
Find the requirements I had to follow in the 'Data_developer_Assignment.pdf' file.
