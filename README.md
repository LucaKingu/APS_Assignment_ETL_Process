## APS Assignment - ETL PROCESS ##

At my data developer role within APS(2025) - ETLs are a huge part of my daily work. Hence, during my interview process I was given an assignment to go create an entire ETL process.
<br />
<br />
Along side the ETL process, I also had to create SQL Queries to be used for reporting (BI Engineering - Reports.sql).
<br />
Find the requirements I had to follow in the 'Data_developer_Assignment.pdf' file.
