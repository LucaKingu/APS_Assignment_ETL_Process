## APS ETL Process Assignment ##

At my data developer role within APS(2025) - ETLs are a huge part of my daily work. Hence, during my interview process I was given an assignment to go create an entire ETL process.
Along side the ETL process, I also had to create SQL Queries to be used for reporting (BI Engineering - Reports.sql).
