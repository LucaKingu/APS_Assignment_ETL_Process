## APS Assignment - ETL PROCESS ##

At my data developer role within APS(2025) - ETLs are a huge part of my daily work. Hence, during my interview process I was given an assignment to create an ETL process. Along side the ETL process, I also had to create SQL Queries to be used for reporting
<br />
The structure goes as follows:
- **`Staging Tables - EXTRACT.sql`**
- **`Transforming - TablesTRANSFORM.sql`**
- **`Loading Tables - LOAD.sql`**
- **`BI Engineering - Reports.sql`**
<br />
<br />
<br />
Find the requirements I had to follow in the 'Data_developer_Assignment.pdf' file.
